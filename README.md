## 🦠 REACH of COVID-19 in India
### 📌 Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes the spread, impact, and vaccination trends of COVID-19 in India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.


### 🎯 Objectives

* Study state/district-wise COVID-19 spread

* Evaluate recovery & mortality rates

* Analyze vaccination progress

* Predict vaccination trends with ML models


### 🧩 Datasets

* covid_19_india (1).csv – State-wise cases

* district_level_latest.csv – District-level stats

* covid_vaccine_statewise.csv – Vaccination data



### 🧹 Preprocessing

* Removed irrelevant columns & handled nulls

* Corrected state names

* Added computed metrics: Recovery, Mortality, Active Cases


### 📊 Analysis Highlights

* State & district-wise case distribution

* Time-series trends (1st & 2nd wave)

* Gender & age-based vaccination insights

* Vaccine type comparison (Covaxin vs Covishield)


### 🤖 Models Used


* Model	Purpose
* Linear Regression	Baseline trend prediction
* Random Forest	High-accuracy ensemble model
* Bayesian Ridge	Probabilistic, stable results


### 🧠 Key Insights

* Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka → highest cases

* Punjab → high mortality rate

* A&N Islands → top recovery rate

* 18–44 age group → most vaccinated


### ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
